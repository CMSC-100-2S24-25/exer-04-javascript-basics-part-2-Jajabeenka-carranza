## Key Takeaways
My key takeaways are that I realized how important documentations are since without it I don't think it would be as easy to import packages especially packages that the developer is not familiar with. I also learned the importance of packages since there are a lot of useful and efficient methods out there to help developers ship code faster and more efficiently, importing with local files are also important to keep each file concise and easier to understand.
